Hello! This a game based on a pygame game template demonstrated at [programarcadegames.com](http://programarcadegames.com/index.php?chapter=introduction_to_graphics).

So far the block moves around with input from the user.

I am currently updating an object-oriented implementation.

This project is under construction.
